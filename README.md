# SigmaStudio Server Registration

This batch file automates the COM object registration process detailed here: https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/usingsigmastudio/scripting/matlab?rev=1522679014

In order to use the batch file, you must have SigmaStudio installed in the default directory (C:\Program Files\Analog Devices\SigmaStudio 3.xx\, where xx is the version number).
Additionally, the correct .NET framework must be installed. Refer to the link above to ensure that you have the right version.

Finally, to use the utility, download the .bat file and run as administrator. It will prompt you for what version of SigmaStudio you wish to register, and whether you use 32- or 64-bit MATLAB.
